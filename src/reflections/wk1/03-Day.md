  ## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
  There were many tips I found very useful, but the most influential for me personally was the offset of shadows and shadow tips in general. I wasn't aware of the different ways to use shadow and how they can range in effectiveness.
  ## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
  The following are some of the examples I find very interesting and helpful for design:

  1\. https://color.adobe.com/create/image- adobe color helps with color matching and good themes.

  2\. https://www.sansfrancis.co/- This website has great photos, colors, inspiration, and fonts.

  3\. https://www.figma.com/file/vewXfmgWeQN9QCw9ELYdiI/Clone-Site?node-id=2%3A0- Figma is one of my favorites because it's fast,easy, and very nice for blocking out a concept. As well as it being very easy to present to others. 
  
  ## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
  Design can make or break a webpage. Design allows the user to have a guided experience into the brand or application. And so if this design comes off rushed or outdated then the user will most likely assume the company isn't professional. The design of a webpage can establish a good relationship with the user and therefore making it easier for them to accept the application.
