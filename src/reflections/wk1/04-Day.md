## What are the benefits to making a plan before jumping into code?
Planning allows the programmer to work alongside others and especially on a big program stay organized and with a consistent work flow. Planning allows for a structure to the work an better communicate the thoughts everyone has towards the application.  


## How do you find answers when stuck?
There are many ways taught to approach a potential problem. To start you must determine if you're trying to force a single solution, often times we can get stuck on one solution and not use git or other resources to rethink the problem. you can always you google to research the problem but never take a sample of code without fully understanding it. 

## Biggest takeaways? 
I consistently struggle with imposter syndrome, I think that I should know much more then I do, so for me the biggest takeaway was that I should never fully think I know what i'm doing. This idea that even an experienced developer will need help or research from time to time makes me feel much better for my future in the industry.
