## Challenges I have overcome this week
My ability to build out a static webpage has skyrocketed. Wednesday I struggled to build even the basic website but near the end of the week my general understanding is much higher. 

## general struggles
I'm struggling mostly with making things look good on mobile and smaller screens. I also just need more time to study the terminology of bootstrap. 


## questions about checkpoint
-I can't seem to get the translate: transformY() to work. I could get the card to spill but couldn't get it to then snap into it's own row without it translating down again. 
-Another issue was the card spill wasn't responsive, the text would overlap it and not be pushed down by it.

Possible solutions:
I thought about either putting an empty column to push the text down and another to push the card up on mobile.

Another possible solution would be removing the translate but only on mobile and I couldn't find anyway to easily do that.
