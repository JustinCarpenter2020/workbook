## What is a List in C#?
A list in c# is essentially the equivialient of an array in javascript. It's used to store data for easy access later on.
## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.add/remove because you'll need to be able to add and remove items from the list. Find and contains seem usefully and common ways to search for specific information. Also maybe index to determine the position on the list. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use list.find in order to find an item in the list. It would go and find the data that matches whatever condition I use in the find params.
