## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are constants of a certain type, this means they are assigned a type on creation and therefore cannot be reassigned later on. Enums are used to keep consistency with what you're expecting to be returned as well as to assign value. 
## How can you modify an Enum?
You can set the value to something other then the default. By doing this you can change the base type to something more suitable. 
## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I haven't used enums in my afternoon labs yet, however they seem to be a useful tool. I would use enums in the case that I have variables that need to be assigned a value but still have names to access. For example monitoring weather and by typing temperature.low, medium, or high will return the associated value.
