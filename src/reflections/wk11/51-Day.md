## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
Inheritance allows for the easy access of variables and conditions. Having inheritance means you can build less and keep things more organized based on what classes have in common.
## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
A class inherits all teh members of its base class as long as those members are not private. Classes inherit everything about the base class but can further define more specific values it holds
## How does accessibility affect inheritance?
Accessibility is the only thing that can really limit inheritance. It allows the developer to decide what will be inherited and what wont be, it also allows the dev to hide certain aspects of the base class.
