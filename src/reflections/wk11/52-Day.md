## What is a List in C#?
A list is in c# is much like an array in javascript, it allows for a developer to easily store and access data. A list has other methods that can used on it separate from an array that allow easy ways to filter, remove, and add.
## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.add/remove because you'll need to be able to add and remove items from the list. Find and contains seem usefully and common ways to search for specific information. Also maybe index to determine the position on the list. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use list.find in order to find an item in the list. It would go and find the data that matches whatever condition I use in the find params.
