# Day 56
__3/1/21__

## Progress
I came in today with my backend done from over the weekend. I spent time testing it and making sure it's solid. Today I started the basics on the frontend so overall i'm feeling really good!


## Problems
My problems were mostly syntax and population issues but all of them are resolved. I need to pick up on the frontend tomorrow and get some pages finished
