# Day 57
__3/2/21__

## Progress
Today I finished my account, home, and vault page. The pages need some fixing on css but they're functional. I was able to get the data I needed and figured out how to make card columns work.


## Problems
I struggled for a good hour on dropping my tables. I was able to get some help from Mick and resolve it but it did take up some time. Tomorrow I need to finish the profile page and vault details page, it would also be nice to do some css.
