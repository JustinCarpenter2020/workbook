# Day 58
__3/3/21__

## Progress
Today I was able to finish the bare bones of the project, I got graded and was able to pass! I also was able to apply more css and work towards some more stretch goals. 


## Problems
The requirements I didn't pass were keep count incrementing, and views. Hopefully I can tackle that or maybe my landing page in the next couple days.
