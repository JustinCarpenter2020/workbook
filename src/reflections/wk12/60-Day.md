# Day 56
__3/5/21__

## Progress
Today I was able to work on questseeker with my other partners that finished early, we fixed it up and did some css work for our presentation on next week.


## Problems
Today it was mostly staying on topic, it's nice to go see how the junior class is doing on hackathon so it was a little hard to stay focused.
