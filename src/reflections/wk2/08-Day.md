## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should each style be used?
Print statements, or directly in the console. Printed statements occur from within the project to better see the value of variables, an example would be console.log(). Writing directly in the console this is helpful if their are lots of bugs in your code or you need to test the code. 

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of css/HTML and how can this tab be useful when debugging?
The sources tab allows for you to look at all your files while in the dev tools. In this tab you can directly add and edit which helps with the debugging process. This tab allows for easy access no only to HTML and CSS but java as well. 

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Another way to debug code is to add break points in order to better inspect the code. It will pause the code in order to view code in a focused way.
