## Challenges overcome?
I feel as though my understanding of css and bootstrap are much better this week, i'm somewhat comfortable with javascript but i'm really enjoying the process.

## Struggles?
Currently i'm not doing well with java challenges, the actual application is fine it's just the whiteboard type challenges I struggle with.

## Checkpoint 2
I had a lot of fun with this one mainly with css, but I like slowly learning and improving.
