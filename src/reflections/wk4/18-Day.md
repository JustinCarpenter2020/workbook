## What is the purpose of async/await
Async/await was created to solve the problem of limitations of promises. They reduce the boilerplate of promises and are essentailly higher level, easier to use promises. 
## What must you do in order to await a promise inside a function?
Once the async keyword is added to the start of a function then that function will return a promise. After that simply put await and the promise into the function. 

## What are some of the primary benefits of async/await?
 The code is much easier to read, it's cleaner, you can do multiple async functions in a series, and it's better for overall debugging purposes.
