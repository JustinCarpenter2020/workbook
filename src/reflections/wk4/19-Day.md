## What does REST stand for and in simple terms what does it mean?
Rest stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Rest is essentially a design pattern for apis, instead of displaying the exact code, it shows a representation of the api. 

## What does stateless mean?
Stateless means that the api doesn't remember anything about the user, any interactions or gets are not recorded. It doesn't remember any of the resources the user wants. 
## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful api?
Endpoint pattern is used when writing RESTful apis. Essentially this means that the end of the url will redirect the user based on the api. Endpoints allow for multiple uses of the api.
