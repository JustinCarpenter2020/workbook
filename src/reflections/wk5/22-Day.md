## What are the three types of relationships?
1. One to one - author and their address
2. One to many - author to their books
3. Many to many - books and generes
## what are the benefits of traditional linking of relationships instead of embedding?
With linking one can easily find and access both pieces of information, this is the preferred method when dealing with any method but one to one. With one to one it is simply easier to have those pieces of information stored together.
## What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many to many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to make it?
Many to many relationships can differ depending on how they relate which may make the way you code or associate them be different. Many to many relationships are known to be the the most difficult relationship to work with correctly.
