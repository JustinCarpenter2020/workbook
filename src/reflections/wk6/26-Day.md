## What is component based architecture?
Component based architecture is the dividing of the page into single components that make it up. Using this method one builds out single pieces of the page and then add them all together.
## What are some benefits of component based architecture?
Using this architecture allows code to more often be reused and keeps the rule of single responsibility intact. This also allows code to be recycled from older projects.
## What are some drawbacks of component based architecture?
Having components interact with one another becomes harder rather then if they all existed on the same page. It can also get confusing when components are nested in components.
