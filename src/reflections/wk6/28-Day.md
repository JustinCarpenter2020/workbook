## What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks are a way to see how the frontend framework you're using is functioning behind the scenes. They are often displayed in the form of a graph.
## what are they used for?
These are used to help the developer know when their components are created, mounted, updated, destroyed, etc. These are useful to help get well acquainted with how the framework handles everything. 
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks are hooks that allow you to access the component right before and after its first render. You would use this if you needed to update the DOM right before or after the <b>first</b> render.
