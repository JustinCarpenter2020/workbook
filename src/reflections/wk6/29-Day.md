## What is a nested route?
Nested routes are routes who are children of a parent route. These routes tend to be accessed only by the parent.
## When would you use a nested route?
You would use a nested routes when you would want a page to have subpages within it. This way those pages only show up on the parent but the main url will adjust accordingly. 
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
You can pass parameters through a nested route, you would often use this if you had a lot of data of a particular type. This makes it easier to find that data and display it.
