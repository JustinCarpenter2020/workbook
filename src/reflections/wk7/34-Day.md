# Day 34
__1/28/21__

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I wanted to try to get better acquainted with pair programming and really hammer in the roles and what each are responsible for. I also tried to keep ux in mind when working with css. 
## What went well?
The pair programming seemed to go very well as me and my partner were on the same page and were well planned. The ux I developed worked, but could use more work.
## What would you do differently?
With pair programming I would switch roles more frequently to allow for even access to the code. The ux I would spend more time on css and really keeping clean code. I would also like to implement code documentation as soon as I read more about it and its best practices.
