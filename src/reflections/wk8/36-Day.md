## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A portfolio is the best way to show future employers that the dev is serious and willing to put in the extra effort. Having a good portfolio not only is good for personal practice but also makes you way more appealing then other candidates. 
## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Having a select few projects of high quality and a place to display them makes a portfolio effective. having a couple large projects gives them more time to shine rather then a bunch of small ones. 
## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I think with a little extra effort and polish on bughunter I would be able to proudly display that. I'm hoping based on the plan with my capstone that that too will be a really nice portfolio piece.
