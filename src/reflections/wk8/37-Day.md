## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Communication needs to be constant so everyone knows exactly what's happening. On top of this there needs to be less meeting in order to actually allow the development team to attain the goals set fourth. 
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
