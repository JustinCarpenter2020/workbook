## What is Software Development Testing?
Testing is where you test your code through means like unit testing. Unit testing allows for the developer to test code without having to interact directly with the client and simulate that test.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
Benefits include confidence that the tested section of code works as intended and can be trusted. It also allows other developers to see the intentions behind the code and how it should work. 
## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Tests must be updated pretty consistently as code changes and developes. In a way tests show how that code worked at that given time and so should be relatively easy to make correct once again.
