## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit: allows developers to test at the smallest possible unit giving them confidence in that section of code. 

Component: allows developers to test components or features but not how they interact with all other features 

E2E: allows developers to test everything in their code from beginning to end but has has had some grievances in the past for being harder to work with.
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
Unit testing is probably the most useful as it takes the least amount of time but returns the a lot of confidence in the code that was written. It seems if everyone rights good unit code everything will go smoothly.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
E2E testing seems the least helpful as it takes a lot of time to preform. Overall I think it's very helpful for the team but should only be used when they have a lot of confidence in their code already.
