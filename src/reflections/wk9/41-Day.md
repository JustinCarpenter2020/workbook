# Day 41
__2/8/21__

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
In our capstone we are utilizing the google maps api, geo-location from the browser, and the basic vue framework with a node backend. Luckily our project doesn't require a ton of technologies so we can really narrow our focus on learning the new information. 
## What went well so far?
We all seem to be willing to compromise in the group, I think our main strength is teamwork and communication, where one of us may lack in ability the others are there with suggestions and assistance. 
## What would you do differently? Why?
I would time-box more, we get a lot done on each of our days but it would be nice to implement strict time-boxes for problems and solutions. Other than that I would just take research time outside of class a little more seriously and really dive in and interact with the new stuff for a smoother implementation.
