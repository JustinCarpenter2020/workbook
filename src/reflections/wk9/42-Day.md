## What is a Github action and how do they work?
An action is an event that occurs under specific conditions and allows the dev to test their code in many different environments. They work by creating workflows and watching for a preset action and when it's taken the action is executed. 
## What benefits do Github actions provide?
They allow the devs to test code in many environments as well as automating the process of a job that needs to occur every time they push, pull, etc. These actions can run a series of steps that need to be checked before a push.
## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
the triggering actions are Push, pull request, or fork. Push is every time code is pushed to github those jobs will be done. Pull request is whenever someone makes a pull request to get the code then a job will run. And a fork is whenever someone forks the repository that the workflow resides on then a series of jobs will be run.
