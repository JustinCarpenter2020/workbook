## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Scrum with a smaller team is more focused on allowed the developers to have the space and time needed to work as their are only a small amount of them. This is done through less timely meetings but more communication through other means like apps, or 5-10 min standups. 
## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
This is to maintain focus and not get caught up in multiple challenges at once. The team can break down the project into just what needs to be done in this one sprint and allows for easy understanding of what's happening. 

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle is the trade offs that come with the production of product. Scrum allows the team to really dial in to what part of the triangle is most important to the client and focus their attention on achieving that goal.
